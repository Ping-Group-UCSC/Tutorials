Attempted to run calculations with GIAO (gauge-invariant atomic orbitals) but it persistently failed

Things I tried:

    > 1,2,3,4 and 8 nodes with 36 cores per node
    > specify restricted memory usage
        >> using maxcore specified 75% of available memory
    > attempted using fewer cores on a single node
    > attempted RIJCOSX
