# note that parameters scissor and onlyElec are not included in original version
# so that they must be commented out for original ePhSpinRelax

# scissor will change the energy of CBM
# in this example, CBM + scissor = dmuMax = 1.14 eV
# so if without scissor and you want to keep dmuMax at CBM,
# you must change dmuMax to 1.14 - 0.537621548118 = 0.602378451882 eV

# in many cases, including both valence and conduction bands make the simulation very hard to converge
# I strongly suggest you to modify the code to add the option including only valence/conduction bands or controlling the band range
