need to add rpa
need to add convergence tests
need to add explanation

From prof:
    -> optic chi preforms linear response which you can use to do IP (IP kernel), RPA (Hartree kernel), and TDDFT (XC kernel)
        -> cheap, no diagonalization
        -> just eps_1 and eps_2
    -> optic bse can preform diagonalization, again you can use it to do IP (IP kernel), RPA (Hartree kernel), TDDFT (XC kernel), in addition to BSE (Screened Coulomb kernel)
        -> diagonalization is expensive
        -> can do transition analysis, exciton analysis, lifetime
